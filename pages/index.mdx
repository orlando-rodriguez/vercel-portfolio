## Orlando Rodriguez

Hello, I'm a Senior Customer Success Manager candidate. I enjoy solving complex challenges and providing guidance to customers on how to maximize the value of our solutions for their business.


I'm passionate about helping my accounts achieve their goals for personalization at scale, unifying voices across the organization for a cohesive plan of action and quantifying impact along the way.
